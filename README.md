# Overview
"Recovery of the Forest" is a platformer that blends simple mechanics with a powerful environmental message. The game invites players to immerse themselves in a vibrant but fragile world threatened by human activities, specifically littering. Players navigate through forested levels, jumping between platforms and avoiding obstacles, as they work towards restoring balance to nature.

The central theme of "Recovery of the Forest" is the impact of human activity on the environment. By guiding the player through a world affected by litter and pollution, the game aims to raise awareness about the importance of protecting nature. As players advance, they uncover deeper truths behind the ecological crisis and the role they can play in reversing it.

In "Recovery of the Forest," players experience a journey that’s not just about gameplay, but also about learning how small actions, like cleaning up litter, can significantly impact the environment.

# Documentation

I made the game "Recovery of the Forest" by involving the game as a platformer focusing on both visual storytelling and environmental awareness. I used a game development platform to build the levels, incorporating movement mechanics such as jumping and crouching. I also implemented collision detection to ensure the player could interact with platforms and obstacles smoothly.

During the process, I have also learnt a variety of skills such as:

Fundamental Basics of Game Development: I learned how to structure a 2D platformer, using sprites and backgrounds to create an engaging game environment.

Scripting or coding: I gained experience in writing scripts to control player movements, level progression, and environmental interactions.

How to use sprites in a game: I enhanced my understanding of visual design, ensuring the art style matched the game’s environmental theme, and improving my skills in creating custom sprites and backgrounds.

Problem-Solving: Debugging and refining the gameplay helped me develop strong problem-solving skills, as I tackled challenges such as level design, obstacle placement, and player feedback.

Below are pictures of scripts/codes that I have written whilst creating the game
